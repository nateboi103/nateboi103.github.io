    <p>Hello and welcome to the land that is known as Anime!</p>
	<p>So you may be asking, what is anime?</P>
	<p>Anime is Japanese animation or Japanese cartoon that is a form of entertainment.</p>
	<p>So you may be asking, why do people watch it in DUBBED instead of SUBBED?!</p>
	<p>People watch it in dubbed instead of subbed because (A)They probably like hearing it in English instead of Japanese (even though hearing it in japanese is better than english).</p>
	<p>(B) They probably can't keep up with the English sub translations.</p>
	<p>(C) Probably because they are kids who don’t know the true meaning behind anime.</p>
	<p> It doesn't have to be only kids; it can be teens or adults who don’t appreciate watching anime in subbed.</p>
	<p> You also may be wondering if anime is for everyone.</p>
	<p> Well, in my opinion, it's up to the person who is wondering if he or she should watch anime or not.</p>
	<p> If you want to watch anime, then it is my pleasure to help you by recommending some anime.</p>
	<p> And if you don't want to watch any anime, that’s fine. But it is highly recommended that you at least try to watch one.</p>
